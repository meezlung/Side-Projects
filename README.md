Random side projects I made

### terminal-based-matching-number-python-game (with gui)
Simple matching number game (somehow like candy crush but not really). Match 3 or more adjacent cells with the same numbers to break the streak. Try to break blocks as many as possible to get a high score!

### terminal-based-minesweeper
Minesweeper.

### terminal-based-solitaire
If you ever feel like playing solitaire and don't want to use a mouse, play this!

## Usage

Enter the following on your terminal. Make sure you are in the right folder directory.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/meezlung/terminal-based-games.git
$ python [put_game_name_here].py
```

Enjoy!
